# srs-igor-8
A collection of macros for Igor Pro v8 for analysing scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy data.

=============================================================================

 A collection of data analysis macros for Igor Pro:

 SRS-STS: functions written to analyse and manipulate STM and CITS data

 SRS-SPECS: functions written to analyse and manipulate photoelectron 
 spectroscopy data

SRS-STM: This is a project that I continue to work on slowly, and that is 
still very much a work in progress.  It is for the analysis of scanning 
tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy data.  While there are many more 
useful packages for the analysis of image data, the strength of these macros
lies in the analysis of tunnelling spectroscopy data, especially in 
CITS spectroscopy data sets.   

SRS-SPECS: There are some line data macros here. These were originally intended 
for XPS and NEXAFS data processing but we now use other packages. As a result 
these are not really maintained but some of the procedures are occasionally useful.

Please feel free to use and/or contribute to these macros, but adhere to the  
licencing agreement. See the LICENSE file for more details.  

I would be very interested to hear how you've used, modified or improved 
these macros.

These files should be installed in (read the Igor Pro help for details)
